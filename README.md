# CODING CHALLENGE
For this challenge, please complete the task **without using AI tools**.  
You may use other resources (documentation, tutorials, forums, etc.), but AI-assisted coding tools are not permitted.

Although we use AI tools internally, this challenge is designed to assess **your own skills and problem-solving approach**.

## Scenario
A colleague began refactoring the notification service but had to leave unexpectedly due to an emergency.  
They left behind partially completed code and asked you to finish the implementation.

The goal of the service is to send notifications to users via email and SMS.

## Time and Goals
Please spend no more than 90 minutes on this task.  
If you get stuck, don’t hesitate to ask for clarification or guidance.  

### Your goals are to:
1. Implement the missing parts of the notification service so it can send both email and SMS notifications.
2. Ensure the code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices.
3. Make the code easy to read and understand.
4. Write a brief README explaining your approach and solution.
5. Bonus: Add at least two unit tests.

## Submission
Please submit your solution as a GitHub repository and share the repository link with us.
